    <h1>Project</h1>
    <p>My project I am proud of is one I made for class that make a QR code for anything I type in a text box and it makes the code with a picture inside. Another project im proud of is my database I had to make for my class. This database was the first one I had made and I spent over 40 hrs to make it work and trouble shoot it.</p>
